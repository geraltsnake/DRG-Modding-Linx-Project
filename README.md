# DRG-Modding-Linx-Project
Linx Project is just a showcase of what I made for DRG modding(This is new project. So these old mods that I created are not included). It might be useful for some people.

## About Linx Project
I'm expanding the project for the solo mode only because I don't enjoy to create the things that relate to the network and I only use mods for singleplayer games only.
And I also don't use the C++ thing and the blueprint dummy method.
